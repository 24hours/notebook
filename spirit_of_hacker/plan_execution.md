# Plan Execution

1. Result mean everything. Be aware confusion of Goal and Result.
 - Goal intended product of plan.
 - Result, outcome due to execution of plan.
2. Result of plan is affected by planning ,execution and execution enviroment.
 - R = P + E + Env
3. Execution enviroment will incur 'cost' if the planning diviate too much from reality.
 - Total_Cost = Cost(P) + (Reality - Reality(P))

## Summary
When making change to enviroment, carefully crafted plan which huge change will always fail. It is best to introduce small change iteratively. But be aware that iteration will make the plan less effective as failure tend to cause losing confident on the plan.

The advice is introduce a grand scheme, rolling them out stage by stage, tweak if possible.


$$ Success(Plan) = \frac{Time}{Scale(Plan) + Affected (people)}Confidence(Plan) $$
